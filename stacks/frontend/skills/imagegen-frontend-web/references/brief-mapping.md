# Baseline Configuration & Brief-to-Direction Mapping

## 1. ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION

- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8
  `(1 = rigid / symmetrical, 10 = artsy / asymmetric)`
- VISUAL_DENSITY: 4
  `(1 = airy / gallery-like, 10 = packed / intense)`
- ART_DIRECTION: 8
  `(1 = safe commercial, 10 = bold creative statement)`
- IMPLEMENTATION_CLARITY: 9
  `(1 = loose moodboard, 10 = very codeable UI reference)`
- IMAGE_USAGE_PRIORITY: 9
  `(1 = mostly typographic, 10 = strongly image-led)`
- SPACING_GENEROSITY: 8
  `(1 = compact / tight, 10 = very spacious / breathable)`
- LAYOUT_VARIATION: 8
  `(1 = same anchor repeats, 10 = bold composition variety across sections)`
- CONVERSION_DISCIPLINE: 8
  `(1 = pure art moodboard, 10 = clear funnel + premium design balance)`

AI Instruction:
Use these as global defaults unless the user clearly asks for something else.
Do not ask the user to edit this file.
Adapt these values dynamically from the prompt.

Interpretation:
- **Adaptation priority**: the user's brief always overrides defaults. Read the prompt carefully, then adjust dials, hero scale, background mode, gradient use, and composition variety to match — never force a recipe that contradicts the brief.
- If the user says "clean", reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says "crazy creative", increase variance and art direction.
- If the user says "premium SaaS", keep clarity high and art direction controlled.
- If the user says "editorial", allow stronger type and more asymmetry.
- Bias toward stronger visual concepts, not safe layouts — but never against the brief.
- Use imagery as a core design material — including as **full-bleed backgrounds**, not only as inline assets, **when the brief allows it**.
- Vary composition: do not default to "text left, image right". Move text to bottom-left, center, top-right, etc. across sections.
- Keep sections breathable. Do not over-pack the page.
- Prefer slightly more whitespace between sections than default.
- Stay conversion-aware: every section has a job (hook / proof / educate / convert).

## Brief-to-direction mapping
Read the brief. Then bias the picks like this:

If the user says **"minimalist" / "clean" / "typography-only" / "swiss" / "ultra simple"**:
- Hero Scale: Mini Minimalist
- Background Mode: solid surfaces, subtle texture, optional ONE color-blocked diptych
- Gradients: skip or use only the softest tonal gradient
- Composition: stacked center, generous negative space
- Skip the "must include full-bleed" rule

If the user says **"editorial" / "magazine" / "art-directed" / "fashion"**:
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial or Giant Statement
- Background Mode: editorial side-image, duotone treated image, atmospheric photo grade
- Gradients: subtle tonal grades only
- Composition: off-grid editorial offset, asymmetric pulls
- Strong typography contrast

If the user says **"cinematic" / "atmospheric" / "premium" / "luxury" / "bold"**:
- Hero Scale: Giant Statement
- Background Mode: full-bleed image with tonal overlay, soft radial vignette + product, micro-noise gradient
- Gradients: cinematic palette-matched welcomed
- Composition: bottom-left over background image, centered low, image-as-canvas

If the user says **"SaaS" / "product" / "dashboard" / "fintech" / "infra"**:
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial
- Background Mode: solid + inline asset, flat block + detail crop, occasional editorial side-image
- Gradients: very subtle, palette-matched only
- Composition: clear product framing, trust-driven anchors
- Slightly higher implementation clarity

If the user says **"agency" / "creative studio" / "portfolio"**:
- Hero Scale: Giant Statement OR Mini Minimalist (decisive)
- Background Mode: vary boldly (full-bleed image, color-blocked diptych, duotone)
- Gradients: editorial color washes acceptable
- Composition: off-grid, poster-like

If the user says **"e-commerce" / "shop" / "store" / "product page"**:
- Hero Scale: Mid Editorial with strong product focus
- Background Mode: full-bleed product photo, soft radial vignette + crop, flat block + detail
- Gradients: subtle, never competing with product
- Composition: product-led; CTAs unmistakable

If the brief is silent on style:
- Use defaults above + the variation engine with confident background variety
- Pick one Hero Scale decisively, do not split the difference

Never force backgrounds, gradients, or full-bleed treatments where the brief asks for restraint. Never strip them out where the brief asks for atmosphere.
