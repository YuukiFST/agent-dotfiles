# Design Direction — Baseline Config, Variation Engine, Section Systems

Read this before generating design images: pick the visual direction, tune the baseline sliders, choose section packs, and plan the website's internal image system.

## ACTIVE BASELINE CONFIGURATION

- DESIGN_VARIANCE: 8
  `(1 = rigid / conventional, 10 = highly art-directed / asymmetric)`
- VISUAL_DENSITY: 3
  `(1 = airy / calm, 10 = dense / packed)`
- ART_DIRECTION: 8
  `(1 = safe commercial, 10 = bold creative statement)`
- IMPLEMENTATION_CLARITY: 9
  `(1 = loose moodboard, 10 = highly buildable UI reference)`
- IMAGE_USAGE_PRIORITY: 9
  `(1 = mostly typographic, 10 = strongly image-led when appropriate)`
- SPACING_GENEROSITY: 9
  `(1 = compact / tight, 10 = spacious / breathable)`
- ANALYSIS_PRECISION: 10
  `(1 = broad vibe only, 10 = deep extraction of design details)`
- IMAGE_GENERATION_EAGERNESS: 10
  `(1 = minimal image count, 10 = generate as many images as needed for excellent extraction)`
- UI_SIMPLICITY_DISCIPLINE: 9
  `(1 = willing to add many micro-elements, 10 = aggressively reduce clutter and unnecessary UI chrome)`

AI Instruction:
Use these as defaults unless the user clearly wants something else.
Adapt them to the prompt.

Interpretation:
- If the user says "clean", reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says "crazy creative", increase variance and art direction.
- If the user says "premium SaaS", keep clarity high and art direction controlled.
- If the user says "editorial", allow stronger type and more asymmetry.
- Keep sections breathable.
- Prefer readability over squeezing too much into one image.
- In Codex, bias strongly toward larger, more analyzable section images.
- If more images would improve extraction quality, generate more images.
- Do not be lazy with image count.
- Default away from nested containers, excessive pills, tiny labels, and dashboard clutter.

## THE COMBINATORIAL VARIATION ENGINE

To avoid repetitive AI-looking output, internally choose a strong combination and commit to it consistently.

Do not mash everything into chaos.
Pick a coherent visual direction and execute it clearly.

### Signature Component Set
Choose exactly 4 unique components:

- infinite brand marquee strip
- turning polaroid arc
- vertical rhythm lines
- off-grid editorial layout
- product UI panel stack
- split testimonial quote wall
- layered image crop frames

### Motion-Implied Language
Choose exactly 2:
- scrubbing text reveal energy
- pinned narrative section energy
- staggered float-up energy
- parallax image drift energy
- smooth accordion expansion energy
- cinematic fade-through energy

These are not coding instructions.
They are visual-direction cues the design should imply.

## WEBSITE IMAGE SYSTEM RULE

When generating a website design, think not only about the overall site but also about the internal image system used inside the website itself.

This may include:
- hero media
- section images
- editorial crops
- product visuals
- framed photography
- layered image cards
- gallery-like blocks
- supporting visual panels

If the site benefits from multiple images, include multiple image moments across the website.

Rules:
- image usage must feel deliberate
- image count should match the complexity of the site
- do not rely on one single hero image if many sections need visual support
- keep image usage balanced and clean
- all image moments must still feel like one coherent design world

## FIXED MEDIA FRAME RULE

Images inside the website should usually sit inside clear, controlled, implementation-friendly frames.

Prefer:
- fixed-aspect media blocks
- clearly framed image areas
- repeatable media modules
- consistent corner radius logic
- stable visual proportions across similar sections

Examples:
- hero image in a clearly bounded large frame
- editorial crops using repeatable portrait or landscape ratios
- card images with consistent proportions
- gallery blocks with controlled aspect ratios
- product images placed in stable intentional containers

Avoid:
- random image sizes with no system
- inconsistent proportions across similar modules
- messy scaling
- uncontrolled collage chaos unless explicitly requested

The goal is:
- visually strong images
- inside a system a frontend model can realistically rebuild

## TYPOGRAPHY-FIRST DISCIPLINE

Typography is a primary design material.

Always ensure:
- clear size contrast
- obvious reading order
- strong display moments
- readable body text
- concise copy
- section headings that reinforce structure

For editorial directions:
- let typography shape composition

For tech/product directions:
- let typography communicate trust and precision

## SECTION RHYTHM RULE

A high-end site does not feel like the same block repeated forever.

Vary section rhythm across the page by changing:
- density
- image-to-text ratio
- alignment
- scale
- whitespace
- card grouping
- background intensity
- visual tempo

But:
- keep the page coherent
- keep spacing controlled
- avoid random jumps
- keep each section clean enough to analyze well

## DENSITY & SPACING DISCIPLINE

Do not make the website too dense.

The page should breathe.

Rules:
- use even section spacing
- keep major section gaps controlled and intentional
- allow negative space to create calmness
- avoid one section feeling cramped while the next feels empty
- smaller sections should still have enough surrounding space
- prefer analyzable generous spacing over compressed compositions
- do not fill every available area with extra UI
- let simplicity do part of the design work

A premium website should feel:
- open
- composed
- balanced
- confident
- breathable

Not:
- cramped
- noisy
- uneven
- overfilled
- visually exhausting

## DEFAULT SECTION PACKS

### 4-section pack
1. Hero
2. Features
3. Social proof / testimonial
4. CTA

### 8-section pack
1. Hero
2. Trust bar
3. Features
4. Product showcase
5. Benefits / use cases
6. Testimonials
7. Pricing
8. CTA

### 12-section pack
1. Hero
2. Trust bar
3. Feature grid
4. Product preview
5. Problem / solution
6. Benefits
7. Workflow
8. Metrics / proof / integration
9. Testimonials
10. Pricing
11. FAQ
12. CTA + footer

In Codex, these should usually become section-by-section images, not one compressed sheet.

## MULTI-IMAGE CONSISTENCY RULE

For multi-image websites, enforce:
- same brand world
- same type scale logic
- same spacing discipline
- same CTA styling
- same icon mood
- same image treatment
- same tonal language
- same component family

Image 2, 3, or 8 must not drift into a different website.
