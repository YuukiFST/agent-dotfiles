# Image Generation — Detail, Regeneration, and Examples

Read this when planning or generating the design images (deciding image count, regenerating unclear sections, or adding detail images).

## GENERATE ENOUGH IMAGES RULE (detail)

Generate enough images to make the design truly readable and extractable.

Do not be lazy with image count.

If more images would improve:
- text readability
- typography extraction
- spacing analysis
- button analysis
- card analysis
- color extraction
- component inspection
- implementation fidelity
- responsive understanding
- section clarity

then generate more images.

Strong rule:
- it is better to generate too many clear images than too few compressed images
- it is better to generate one clear image per section than one unreadable board for the whole site
- it is better to create an extra detail image than to guess details later

Never reduce image count just for convenience if that harms quality.

## CODEX-SPECIFIC SECTION IMAGE RULE (detail)

Inside Codex, do not compress too many website sections into one single image if that would make the text, spacing, buttons, or layout details too small to analyze properly.

In Codex, prefer separate large images per section. Default rule inside Codex: N sections requested → generate N images (1 → 1, 2 → 2, ... 10 → 10, and so on when reasonable).

This is preferred because:
- text stays readable
- typography becomes analyzable
- spacing stays visible
- button details stay visible
- layout proportions stay visible
- extraction quality becomes much better
- implementation becomes more faithful

Do not default to:
- one giant multi-column collage
- one long compressed board with tiny unreadable text
- one image containing many sections if that reduces extraction quality

If necessary, generate more images rather than shrinking everything.

Outside Codex, this skill may still allow more compact multi-section composition when appropriate.
Inside Codex, prioritize section clarity and extraction accuracy.

## FRESH RE-GENERATION RULE

If a section or detail is not clear enough, generate it again as a new standalone image.

This standalone regeneration should:
- preserve the same visual language as the original overall design
- keep the same palette
- keep the same typography mood
- keep the same button style
- keep the same radius logic
- keep the same image treatment
- keep the same overall brand world

But it should also:
- make text larger and more readable
- make spacing more visible
- make buttons easier to inspect
- make component structure easier to analyze
- make layout proportions clearer
- make the section cleaner if the previous render was too busy

This is not a different design.
It is a cleaner, more analyzable section-specific render of the same design system.

## OPTIONAL DETAIL / EXTRACTION IMAGE RULE

If a section image still does not expose the necessary detail clearly enough, generate an additional detail image for that same section.

Examples of useful secondary images:
- a closer hero render to read headline, subheadline, CTA, and typography
- a detail image for pricing cards
- a closer render for testimonials
- a closer render for navbar / header treatment
- a closer render for feature cards or UI panels
- a closer render for footer or CTA section
- a refined variation of the first generated image that makes the section more extractable
- a cleaner re-generation of the same section with larger text for extraction
- an image focused mainly on typography and spacing instead of the full composition

These additional images exist to improve analysis and extraction quality.

Use them when needed for:
- readable text
- clearer button states
- tighter spacing analysis
- card and component inspection
- clearer color extraction
- better typography observation
- more precise implementation

Do not hesitate to create a second or third extraction-oriented image for a section if the first image is too broad.

## SECTION IMAGE GENERATION RULE

Inside Codex, treat each section as its own analyzable unit.

If the user asks for:
- a hero only → generate 1 hero image
- 4 sections → generate 4 section images
- 8 sections → generate 8 section images
- 12 sections → generate 12 section images when reasonable

General preference:
- one section = one primary image
- one complex section = one primary image + one or more optional detail images
- one unclear section = regenerate it again as a fresh clean standalone image

This section-first generation rule exists to prevent:
- tiny unreadable text
- tiny buttons
- unclear spacing
- weak extraction quality
- lossy design-to-code translation

## EXAMPLE INTERPRETATIONS

### Example 1
User:
"make me one hero section for an AI startup"

Interpretation:
- generate 1 hero image
- if needed, generate 1 closer extraction image for text/buttons
- do not crop a small region out of a larger board
- if more clarity is needed, regenerate the hero as a fresh cleaner standalone image
- keep the hero calm and readable
- avoid fake utility labels and nested cards
- analyze headline, subheadline, CTA, spacing, colors, hero media
- then implement the hero

### Example 2
User:
"design me an 8-section landing page"

Interpretation:
- generate 8 separate section images in Codex
- one per section
- generate extra detail images where necessary
- deeply analyze all 8 sections
- extract text, typography, spacing, buttons, colors, cards, structure
- if one section is still unclear, regenerate that section again cleanly instead of cropping
- keep sections open and not overboxed
- then implement the full site from those references

### Example 3
User:
"make a premium creative agency website with 4 sections"

Interpretation:
- generate 4 separate section images in Codex
- keep the hero very clean
- ensure text remains readable
- deeply analyze each section
- do not use rough cutouts from the first renders
- regenerate clearer section images if needed
- avoid over-pilled microcopy and container overload
- then implement the site from those 4 references
